# Short reviews and opinions on resources

These will be fussed over given more time and thoughts.

* Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science (2nd ed)
  * [Publisher's link](https://fbeedle.com/our-books/8-python-programming-an-introduction-to-computer-science-2nd-ed-9781590282410.html)
  * By John Zelle
  * This is a platform agnostic book with a nicely casual voice.  The distinction between command prompt vs scripts could be formatted better, but gives me flexibility in the software that I required my students to use.  The chapters are pretty to the point and in a decent order, starting with numbers and strings.  List information is a tad scattered through several chapters and hard to get a clear reference.  Starts with file processing early and shows a nice variety of reading methods, although some of the iteration patterns are a bit glossed over.  Has a strong focus on using the `end = ` and `file =` in the `print()` function, which students really like. This can create some funky misconceptions and problems as students progress to more advanced topics, but can be handled when the time comes.  Dictionaries could use earlier and longer introduction.  Doesn't talk about regular expressions much.  The index could also use some retooling, but isn't terrible.  The updated 3rd edition has a lot of other commentary about 2nd edition content.
  * Overall:  this edition has proven to be pretty flexible to adapt to, but making it work for my crew requires a lot of extra content on my part.  I only use half of the chapters, so there's a lot of extra info that students can use later.  The price tag is also A+ and frankly a strong reason to keep using it.  I've used this for 3 semesters and students remain mostly neutral/positive about it.
* Python for Everyone
  * By Dr. Charles R. Severance 
  * https://www.py4e.com/book.php
  * Very pithy, pattern and task based.  I have optional readings from this book aligned with all my regular course content.  I've fussed with the order a bit.  A nice alternative voice for my students, and many have very positive opinions on it.  A little too small to be used alone for my class, but a great resource.

# Other reviews

* Python Programming in Context (2014)
  * By Miller and Ranum
  * [Publisher's link](http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9781449699390/)
  * I taught with this book for a semester and switched away.  Very math heavy without a lot of background.  Chapter two is teaching loops via trigonometry.  I found some of the patterns and content used to be very heavy for a novice level book.  I do like the content and variety of Python usage in here, but the math dependency and advance syntax make this not a great choice for my crew.  Likely better for those with computational interests or some previous exposure to another programming language.
  
* The Self-Taught Programmer  (2017)
  * By Cory Althoff
  * https://theselftaughtprogrammer.io/
  * I liked the voice of this book and the formatting of IDLE vs scripts is really clear.  Pithy with lots of examples and practical applications.  I was very positive about reading through this book, and strongly considering using this book as a supplement to my current materials.  I have a friend who was working through it solo, and regularly asked me questions about the examples, which is how I came to learn about it.  Some of the examples use funky patterns that a certainly functional, but can set up for traps or problems as students try to adapt them in more advance contexts.  I also found some technical inaccuracies that were disappointing.  I'm eager to keep an eye on this book for future updates, but ultimately rejected it for use with my course.
