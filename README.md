# IS452 Textbook reviews
Repository to track books that I've considered for my IS452 course.

# Where are the things?

* [Books I know about](books-i-know-about.md) is a dumping ground of resources I've already considered.
* [Reviews](reviews.md) is the collection of books I've looked at and thoughts.

# tl;dr

IS452 is a grad level introduction to programming course with in School of Information Sciences at Illinois.  This is meant for students with zero prior exposure to programming and designed to prepare them to be end user programmers.  

I'm always on the lookout for a good intro to python book for my class and I'm trying to document that search process so I can share my list of resources with other instructors.

# Why?

I'm making this public so I can keep track of what I've seen and be transparent about the process.  I also get asked about books for teaching Python with A LOT, so I'd love to be able to provide this link instead of word vomiting on twitter.

I will be working with a TA during Summer 2018 to review more books, so she and I will be entering in reviews as we go.

# Please help!

I'm making this public so I can keep track of what I've seen and be transparent about the process.  I also get asked about books for teaching Python with A LOT, so I'd love to be able to provide this link instead of word vomiting on twitter.

So I'd love for you to recommend books that I should consider or review for my class.

## Please do...

* Recommend materials and resources you've used, have opinions about, and align with my needs.  
* Negative opinions are OK! Because my needs might be different or that might help my avoid a time sink.  
* Third hand reccs ("my friend liked this one") are also fine!
* Check that it isn't already on my list of things I've looked at.
* Keep all comments constructive.  Imagine that the author will read these comments and be nice.

## Please don't...

* no link vomit all the results for books with Python in the title on Amazon.  I've been searching for the right book for 2 years now, I've done the searches. 
* don't get mad if I consider your recommendation and reject it.  Please watch Brett Cannon's keynote before rage commenting: https://youtu.be/tzFWz5fiVKU?t=49m43s
* flame any books/authors or say that something is bad or good without constructive qualification
* please no "for kids" books
* ditto on scratch

## How?

So if you'd like to make a suggestion:

* thank you! I really appreciate you taking the time to contribute.  ❤️
* make a new issue
* give me all the information you can on how I can track the book down (amazon or publisher link is fine)
* tell me a little of why you are making the recommendation
* you can combine multiple resources into one issue if you want
* check that your language is welcoming and constructive before submission

## Considerations 

The students are mostly from MS-Library Information Science and MS-Information Management, but we regularly get professional development students and grad students from other departments. The majority of MS-LIS students come from humanities undergrads, and IM students (who take this course) are usually from business or stem field that didn't involve data programming.

The voice of instruction in this class is of practical data processing and data wrangling, with a goal of producing well prepared end user programmers.  This is not considered a class to prepare students for dev/engineering positions, nor is it a foundational class for further required courses.  There are some advanced courses that some students will take, but very few of them will.

## Desires

### About the boook:

* be an actual textbook.  Meaning that there are practice problems, quizzes, have a sick ass reference section, and please please a good index.  
* be for actual beginners who have never writen or seen a line of code before in any context.  Just because a book covers variable assignment and if statements doesn't mean it's meant for beginners.
* Books meant purely for reference (like cookbooks) aren't designed well for a university course structure.  
* This is also a 16 week session and needs to have substantive content for that.
* Be script first but platform/software agnostic to the use of command prompt vs scripts.  If a book only shows the use of IDLE it is hell on earth trying to get some people out of that environment.  
* I'm open to online/OER materials.
* I'm also open to expensive books, but it must be hella awesome for me to require a $100+ book.

### About the content I want: 

* Math: as little as possible. Yes this can be done. Yes it is fine. Don't `@` me.
* Strings/text: as much as possible, please!
* lists/dictionaries:  COLLECT ALL THE THINGS, but please leave the comprehensions at the door
* OOP: not interested or way later
* while loops: (for Python) maybe if you do something cool with data, but please no number guessing games. It doesn't translate well to data processing.
* files: yes please! but also more working with CSVs, JSON, XML, etc.

### The realistic requirements:

I know all these things won't exist in one, so I expect to put in work to make it work.  So here are my more realistic requirements:

* strings/data first perspective
* have modular chapters so I can reorder things without dependency wrecking my students
* cover essential concepts & patterns that I can build on with our context
* be software agnostic so I have freedom to choose which one works the best for us and adapt to current industry and educational standards
