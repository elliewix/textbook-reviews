# Books I know about and have previously considered

Sort of a dumping ground for books that I already know about.  Books will be removed from this list once I write a review about them.  Some of these have been reviewed already and waiting for me to write something.

* "Python for Informatics"/"Python for Everybody" by Severance. I already use this as a supplement.
* "Python Programming" 3rd edition by Zelle.  I'm currently using the 2nd edition and considering if I should update the course for the 3rd edition
* "Starting out with Python" 4th edition by Tony Gaddis
* "Introduction to Computing and Programming in Python" 4th edition by Guzdial and Ericson
* "Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python" (2013) by John Guttag
* "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python" 2nd edition by Miller and Ranum
* "Pragmatic Programmer" (2000) by Hunt and Thomas
* "Practical Programming" 3rd Edition by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, Jason Montojo

* there's a ton of O'Reilly and No Starch Press books already on my shelf.
